# CacheSimulation

In order to run the cache simulation, 
1. Download the source files into a folder.
2. Change the filePath and fileName variables in main.cpp to match the path and name of the trace file you would like to simulate.
3. Run the code, it should take around 15 minutes to output a table of a variety of simulations run on the .trace file. 
The simulations will test different combinations of replacement policy, cache design, and cache size. 
4. If you would like to simulate custom caches, simply change the parameters used when creating the cache objects.
